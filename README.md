### Hi there ðŸ‘‹, my name is Tunaberk
#### Whether it's backend logic or frontend layouts, I enjoy piecing things together to make cool and clean experiences. ðŸ§©


I started my journey in tech at Istanbul Technical University, and now I'm continuing to level up my skills at BoÄŸaziÃ§i University. I'm all about writing clean code, learning by doing, and building things that make life easier (or at least cooler).
